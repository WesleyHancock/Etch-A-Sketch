# Etch-A-Sketch
Something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

# Provide a selection for various canvas sizes
16 x 16 has individual width and height of 30px
The container has height and width of 480px.

1. Need a menu for the user to select options from, such as:
- canvas size and square ratio
- color to draw in
- rainbow color mode
- eraser
- reset canvas

# Canvas size and square ratio
- minumum up to maximum size
- minumum size 16 x 16 = 256 squares
- maximum size 64 x 64 = 4096 squares
- Use an input type range to select the different sizes

- need to retrieve the input
- multiply the input by itself to get the amount of squares necessary
